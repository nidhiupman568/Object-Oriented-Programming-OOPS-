# Key Points of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Essential for Interviews

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a crucial concept in software development and frequently discussed in technical interviews. Here are some important points we should master:

## 1. **Encapsulation**
- **Definition:** Bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that manipulate the data into a single unit called a class.
- **Benefits:** Protects the data from unauthorized access and modification, enhances modularity, and makes the code easier to manage.

## 2. **Inheritance**
- **Definition:** Mechanism by which one class (child/subclass) inherits the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class (parent/superclass).
- **Benefits:** Promotes code reusability, reduces redundancy, and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.

## 3. **Polymorphism**
- **Definition:** Ability to present the same interface for different data types. Methods can be overridden (run-time polymorphism) or overloaded (compile-time polymorphism).
- **Benefits:** Enhances flexibility and integration, allows for one interface to be used for a general class of actions.

## 4. **Abstraction**
- **Definition:** Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.
- **Benefits:** Simplifies the complexity of the system, helps in focusing on what an object does instead of how it does it.

## 5. **Classes and Objects**
- **Class:** Blueprint or template from which objects are created. Contains methods and attributes.
- **Object:** Instance of a class. Represents a real-world entity with state and behavior.

## 6. **Constructors and Destructors**
- **Constructors:** Special methods called when an object is instantiated. Used for initializing the object's state.
- **Destructors:** Special methods called when an object is destroyed. Used for cleanup activities.

## 7. **Access Modifiers**
- **Types:** Public, Private, Protected
- **Purpose:** Controls the visibility and accessibility of class members.

## 8. **Method Overriding vs. Overloading**
- **Overriding:** Subclass provides a specific implementation for a method already defined in its superclass.
- **Overloading:** Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class.

## 9. **Design Patterns**
- **Common Patterns:** Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy, etc.
- **Importance:** Provides proven solutions to common problems, enhances code readability, and promotes best practices.

## 10. **SOLID Principles**
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
- **Significance:** Helps in writing scalable, maintainable, and robust code.
